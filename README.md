## Projects
### FieldBook _(Android Applications in Java and Flutter/Dart)_

Created custom mobile apps to investigate the effects of GPS inaccuracy on user performance and behaviour in agricultural field research context. Carried out outdoor field studies with participants to collect empirical evidence for the research work presented in the master’s thesis.

### Full Support of Python 3 in GRASS GIS – Google Summer of Code _(Python)_

Updated core GRASS components for Python 3 and update all the python modules, libraries and components. Modified the GUI module and provided support for both the versions of wxPython (Classic (3 or older) and Phoenix (4)).

### Image Manipulation _(Python, FastAPI, MySQL, Docker)_

Developed an image manipulation Python application using FastAPI and containerized it using docker. The application takes PNG or JPEG image format as input and outputs a compressed version to the user via a download link through the frontend UI. Database support using MySQL allows to store results and provide the users with an option to download previously generated files.

### Audio Converter _(C#, .NET, Docker)_

Developed a .NET REST API application that aims to convert audio files uploaded in wav format and provide an mp3 version as a result.  The user is able to download the converted audio file through a link on the application webpage. The application is containerized using docker.

### Sentiment Analysis _(Python, Gephi)_

Performed sentiment analysis of twitter data for tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines. The data was collected using the twitter API, data cleaning and preprocessing was done using regular expressions. Social network analysis was performed using Gephi and Python and results with data visualizations presented important trends and datapoints in the network.

### Forceful Cooperation _(C#, Unity)_

Built a 2D platformer game as part of a team at Game Jam, USask. The game assets were created in GIMP. The game explored the theme ‘Force’ and won the best novice game at the competition.
